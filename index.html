The Vice documentary intrigued him so much he had to fly over to Poland to learn from Wim.<br>Now two years later, he is practicing surfing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and yoga on a daily basis.<br>He claims that the Wim Hof Method has been the key component to shift his lifestyle, and he is excited to share his practice.</p>

								<p>Sungho’s blend of gentleness and enthusiasm created a space for everyone to relax, open up, and go deep. His personal story of using the WHM to overcome screen addiction and personal demons touched me and illuminated layer to this powerful healing method. The instruction on the fundamentals was concise and he was able to answer the group’s questions and concerns. The addition of sauna time after the ice bath was an awesome bonus! This was an all-around successful introduction to the WHM and left me with encouragement to continue the practice.</p>

								<p>My wife and I went to our first Wim Hof experience. Breathing and we had the choice of getting in the ice. Everyone in our class decided to get in. I’ve done the breathing alone but it was so much better having Sungho lead and guide us, he has a very fun and calming spirit, truly made the experience that much better. I will definitely be attending any future events with Sungho.</p>

								<p>What a joy to learn the Wim Hof method from Sungho. His passion for this work and expertise is coupled with such an honest and heartfelt experiential story of how it has helped him. It makes him a really gifted teacher; in his integrity and full of joy to share. I highly recommend learning with him. Thank you for helping me breathe and connecting with me when I first got in the ice - that reassurance and presence was appreciated and meaningful to me. I can&rsquo;t wait for weekly classes!!!</p>

								<p>I attended Sungho&rsquo;s class on April 20th, 2019. He was assisted by his fellow instructor, Josh. After a brief presentation explaining the history and philosophy of the Wim Hof Method, Sungho guided the group through breathing techniques. His base of knowledge and style of communication made me feel comfortable and safe. Sungho was attentive and compassionate, while infecting the group with his enthusiasm for the benefits that these techniques bring. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested or even curious about the benefits of the Wim Hof Method.</p>

								<p>I had serious doubts about being able to get into an ice bath. But with the help of the coach and classmates I did it!! And it was not bad at all. I thought workshop was informative, coach and his team were well prepared, going the extra mile, great location - building with studios, rooftop for bath, sauna, showers. Instructor in training took great pictures and even a short video of me in the ice bath, so fun to share them with my friends! It was nice to meet same minded group of people since when I told my friends I was going to take an ice bath, reactions were not so positive. Attendees were at different levels of practice/experience, it was nice to share tips and tricks. All in all, great experience! Icewoman-in-the-making</p>

								<p>I am an overweight 48 year old male who aside from fighting weight issues. The real surprising, and someone might say miraculous, experience happened while I was in the cold bath. Prior to getting into the cold bath I was completely unable to bend my right knee due to the major Gout episode that was happening ON the day of the workshop! :-( Then all of the sudden while in the cold bath I was surprisingly able to bend my knee and get lower into the bath! I would then reach into the bath to feel if the fluid build up had somehow been reduced and the build up was basically gone within just a few minutes in the cold bath!!!</p>
